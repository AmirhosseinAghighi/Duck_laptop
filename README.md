# Introduction
This project aims to recreate the Windows 11 user interface within the FiveM framework. It is a work in progress, with a current focus on developing the UI.

# Background
Last year, I embarked on this project as my third venture into Vue.js. While I didn't have much experience with Vue.js at the time, I was excited to challenge myself and learn more about this powerful JavaScript framework. However, due to various reasons, I had to put the project on hold for a while.

# Current Status
I am excited to announce that I have recently resumed working on this project. Drawing upon the knowledge and experience I have gained since then, I am confident in my ability to create a more polished and visually appealing user interface. Please note that the uploaded files may not reflect the most recent changes.

Goals
* Recreate the Windows 11 UI within the FiveM framework.
* Pay attention to detail and strive for a visually stunning design.
* create item for it in game
* Save the current data variables in the item metadata to be realistic
